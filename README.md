twitter-archive-topic-model
===========================

Takes a provided csv file of tweets from Twitter's archive feature and creates a topic model with the help of MALLET

There are many tunable parameters for topic modelling - take a look [here](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) for some more information.

Twitter's archive contains a few different formats, but this works with the tweets.csv file. 

Prerequisites
-------------

* You must have [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php) available on your system. 
* You'll need to request an archive of your tweets from Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/settings/account)
