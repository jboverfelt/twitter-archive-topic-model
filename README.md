twitter-archive-topic-model
===========================
Attempts to provide a rough overview of the topics someone tweets about using 
the tweet archive that can be requested from the account settings menu on Twitter.

For a general overview of topic modeling, see [this paper](http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/SteyversGriffithsLSABookFormatted.pdf)

There are many tunable parameters for topic modeling that affect the fidelity of the model. 
Take a look [here](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) for some more information.

Twitter's archive contains a few different formats, but this works with the tweets.csv file. 

### Prerequisites

* You must have [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php) available on your system. 
* You'll need to request an archive of your tweets from Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/settings/account)
